## Reporting a Vulnerability
If you discover a security vulnerability within our application, we encourage you to notify us as soon as possible. Please follow these steps:

1. **Do Not Create a Public Issue**: To help us protect the confidentiality of our users, please do not disclose the vulnerability publicly until we have had a chance to address it.
2. **Email Us**: Send an email to [security@paculvm.com](mailto:security@paculvm.com) with the subject line "Security Vulnerability Report". Include a detailed description of the vulnerability, steps to reproduce it, and any other relevant information.
3. **Wait for a Response**: Our security team will review the report and get back to you as soon as possible.

## Security Updates
We strive to improve the security of our products continuously. Regular updates will be made available to address reported vulnerabilities and enhance security features.

## Security Best Practices
To aid users in maintaining their security while using our products, we recommend:
- Regularly updating dependencies to their latest versions
- Using strong, unique passwords and enabling two-factor authentication (2FA) where possible
- Keeping backups of important data

## Acknowledgements
We appreciate the contributions of the security community in helping us to maintain the security of our software. Users who report vulnerabilities in line with these guidelines may be acknowledged in our documentation (if they wish to be).

## Disclaimer
While we strive to bring users the highest quality of service, we cannot guarantee that all vulnerabilities will be identified or resolved in a specific time frame. Users are advised to take appropriate actions to secure their own data.
